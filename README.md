> Real-time Dashboard for festivals

## :book: Introduction
[Turn down for Watt](https://youtu.be/dE-nfzcUiPk?t=14s) *(TDFW)* is an Real-Time application used by Food Trucks on large open festivals.

### Use Case
#### Before the festival
A food truck registers all the appliances it brings to the festival. Based on the number of appliances and the energy each appliance consumes the Food Truck gets a **label** for that particular festival. Each label has a **subscription**. This subscription has a maximum usage of energy consumed during the days of the festival. (For example *2100Kwh*).

*The Food Truck is forced to think about the energy they consume and can consider bringing less appliances to the festival to keep the cost down.*

#### During the festival
